Stores all react context file.
Context is used to pass down data that needs to be shared between many components

For example, every button, form, etc. would need to know whether the user is using dark mode or light mode
Rather than passing it down from "ExampleParent" > "ExampleChild.props.theme"
You would just do 
<ThemeProvider>
    <ExampleParent>
</ThemeProvider>

This way parent and any child elements after that would still have access to the variable provided by themeprovider
